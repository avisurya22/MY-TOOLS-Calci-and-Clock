# MY-TOOLS-Calci-and-Clock
Created a nice-looking website using CSS, HTML and JavaScript named MY Tools which has tools like Online Calculator(2nd webpage) and Digital running clock(third webpage) which also shows date and day Also made a signup form template for our website and navigation menu contains Home, About us, and Sign up form (4th webpage)options. Tried to put three different projects into a single website and in the future, will add more tools to it. 
The project files are in the master branch of this repo. You can download and open Home.html
